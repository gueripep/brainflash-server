# NOTES:
# - This prod compose file purposefully removes mounts of the application source and GCP
#   credentials so that builds use the image context and secrets are handled separately.
# - Create a `.env.prod` with required env vars (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, any GCP credentials,
#   SECRET_KEY, etc.) and avoid committing secrets to the repo.
# - If you prefer to run behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, remove the host port
#   binding and expose only internal ports.
